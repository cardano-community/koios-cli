We would love for you to contribute to [Koios API Client Library for Go][github] and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)
 - [Question or Problem?](#got-a-question-or-problem)
 - [Found a Bug?](#issues-and-bugs)
 - [Missing a Feature?](#feature-requests)
 - [Submission Guidelines](#submission-guidelines)
 - [Coding Rules](#coding-rules)
 - [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines)
 - [Development Documentation](#development-documentation)

### Code of Conduct

Help us keep [Koios API Client Library for Go][github] open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc]

---

### Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [Koios Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/+zE4Lce_QUepiY2U1)

---

### Issues and Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request-pr) with a fix.

---

### Feature Requests

You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request-pr).

---

### Submission Guidelines

#### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

You can file new issues by filling out our [new issue form](https://github.com/cardano-community/koios-cli/issues/new).

---

#### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/cardano-community/koios-cli/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Fork the [cardano-community/koios-cli][github] repo.
3. Setup you local repository

    ```shell
    git@github.com:<your-github-username>/koios-cli.git
    cd koios-cli
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:cardano-community/koios-cli.git
    ```
4. Make your changes in a new git branch and ensure that you always start from up to date main branch. **Repeat this step every time you are about to start woking on new PR**.

    e.g. Start new change work to update readme:
    ```shell
    # if you are not in main branch e.g. still on previous work branch
    git checkout main
    git pull --ff upstream main
    git checkout -b update-readme main
    ```
5. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
6. Follow our [Coding Rules](#coding-rules).
7. If changes are in source code except documentations then run the full test suite, as described in the [developer documentation](#development-documentation), and ensure that all tests pass.
8.  Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
  [commit message conventions](#commit-message-guidelines). Adherence to these conventions
  is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

     ```shell
     git add -A
     git commit --signoff
     # or in short
     git commit -sm"docs(markdown): update readme examples"
     ```
9. Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push -u origin update-readme
    ```
10. In GitHub, send a pull request to `main` branch.
* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

     ```shell
    git fetch --all
    git rebase upstream main
    git push -uf origin update-readme
    ```
That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

---

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:
  
    ```shell
    git push origin --delete update-readme
    ```
* Check out the main branch:
  
    ```shell
    git checkout main -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D update-readme
    ```
* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream main
    ```
---

### Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* All public API methods **must be documented**.

---

### Commit Message Guidelines

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. Commit messages should be well formatted, and to make that "standardized", we are using Conventional Commits. Our release workflow uses these rules to generate changelogs.

---

#### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

*When maintainers are merging PR merge commit should be edited:*

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject> (#pr)
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Samples:

```
docs(markdown): update readme examples
```

```
fix(endpoint): update Tip endpoint to latest specs.

description of your change.
```

```
refactor(client): change Client GET function signature

change order of client GET method arguments.

BREAKING CHANGE: Clien.Get signature has changed
```

---

#### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

---

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: goreleaser, taskfile)
* **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
* **dep**: Changes related to dependecies e.g. `go.mod`
* **docs**: Documentation only changes (example scopes: markdown, godoc)
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **revert**: Reverts a previous commit
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

---

#### Scope

The following is the list of supported scopes:

| scope | description |
| --- | --- |
| **client** | API client related changes |
| **endpoint** | Changes related to api endpoints |
| **godoc** | Go documentation |
| **markdown** | Markdown files |
---

#### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end
  
#### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

#### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

A detailed explanation can be found in this [document][commit-message-format].
